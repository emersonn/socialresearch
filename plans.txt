Crawling Instagram
  - Take a look at the popular page for a particular location
    - Record each step through the photos and the person who has the photos
      - Record each comment, likes
  - "You cannot use the Instagram API to crawl or store users' media without their express consent."
    - Maybe ask around and for permission to label someone's Instagram ideals? It gives them
      a personality? Make it into a viral site to ask what their Instagram is and gives them
      stats about themselves?
      - Take a look at their captions, hashtags, comments, likes, emojis used?
        - Counts of emojis, average, standard deviaions?
        - Most liked comments, most commented pictures, most liked pictures, most expressive hashtags?
      - Maybe get other American students to rate the American's personalities and how outgoing they are?
        On a scale of 1 to 10 how revealing is this picture? How much can you tell from this picture?
        How much emotion does this express?
        - Elo scale on how crazy the picture is? Maybe focus on one thing? How much emotions is this? Swipe
          left or swipe right?
          - What kind of emotion does this picture express? Happy, sad, nothing?

Crawling Twitter
  - API.trends_place() of Germany and places around the United States
    - What do people most talk about? What about their opinions on Fergueson or something? What are their
      emotions? What type of hashtags do they use? What do their friends tweet about?
    - API.search()
    - Sentiment analysis with text classification? NLTK Python? What kind of hashtags do people use in addition
      to the sentiment analysis? text-processing.com

  - Crawling
    - Get the trends. Store as a Trend model with a particular date.
      - Store tweets that follow the trend at that exact time, ~1000.
      - Trends will point to all the Tweets that relate to it.
      - Eventually crawl the tweets and the users that are in the tweets?
        - Have a user object and analyze their personality in the database.

  - Workflow
    - Crawler to populate database with trends, tweets
      - Analyze the trends by looking at most popular trends?
    - Analysis of Tweets
      - Sentiment analysis of tweets to populate database of understanding NLTK
      - Analyze positive/negative sentiment, most common words for particular users
        how much information they share, the location, the places they eat, the emojis they use?
    - Participation in Trends? Especially controversial trends?
    - Need another crawler that takes the streaming API of a particular place and just stores those tweets without trends

  - Analysis
    - Happy/sad? Share personal information (pronouns present)?
      - Textblob and nltk
        - Classify maybe different stats with positive, negative and then combine the distributions of each to
          get a general idea of the particular tweet
            - Sentiment, personal information, can you tell who this person is from this tweet, are they talking about/to
              someone (personal conversation)
    - 3 string columns with pos/neg or however many classifiers there need to be and 3 classifier columns
      with the probability distributions. Then have a script that allows classification by column because now
      rows without classifications can then be classified.

  - python -m socialresearch.twitter.crawl_trends
  - python -m socialresearch.twitter.crawl_stream
